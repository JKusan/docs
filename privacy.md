information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer
to for more information about how these entities use this information.

about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the System (“Aggregate Information”),
such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site or Application. Some of this information is derived
from Personal Information. We reserve the right to use Aggregate Information for any purpose and disclose
it to third parties in our sole discretion. This Aggregate Information is not Personal Information and cannot
be tied back to you, your Account, your web browser or mobile device. We use this anonymous data to
enhance the content of the System and improve the System, for example by allowing us and third parties
authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the System so that we can analyze and
improve them.

**2.11 Email Communications.** We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use
this confirmation to improve our customer service.

**2.12 Like Buttons.** Some third parties’ embedded content or plugins on the System, such as Facebook
“Like” buttons, may allow their operators to learn that you have used the System, and they may combine this
information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or
online services.

**2.13 Information Collected Using Cookies.**  
2.13.1 Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser or
mobile device when you access a website. The information we gather helps us to better understand how you
use the System in order to improve your user experience and the way the System operate. Your browser or
mobile device stores cookies in a manner associated with each website or application you visit. We use
cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser or mobile device and tell us how and when you
use the System.  
2.13.2 Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general
information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted,
however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser or mobile device has accessed aspects of the
System and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.  
2.13.3 Most browsers or mobile devices have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will
prevent your browser or mobile device from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
sophistication of your browser or mobile device software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new
cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable
you to take advantage of some features of the System.  
2.13.4 This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third
parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or mobile device. For
example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or mobile device.  
2.13.5 We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 or Flash to store content information and
preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display
advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such HTML5 to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 and Flash LSOs.  

**2.14 Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons.**  
2.14.1 To support and enhance the System, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties to
serve advertisements, through the System. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to
particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third
party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.  
2.14.2 Advertisements served through the System may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile
category and may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user,
including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Systemusage patterns of particular
users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to
any ad networks for use outside of the System.  
2.14.3 To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from
an ad network to you through the System. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized,
aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks
to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must
request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit
or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.  
2.14.4 If you respond to ads posted by third parties or submit information to third parties via the System,
such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.  
2.14.5 If you come to us through social media sites, from other websites or with devices that enable third
parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to
their privacy policies.  

**2.15 Do Not Track Signals.** Your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may
not have any effect on our collection of cookie information for analytic and internal purposes. The only way
to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology
is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other
tracking/recording tools. (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies, you
may wish to visit allaboutcookies.org)
