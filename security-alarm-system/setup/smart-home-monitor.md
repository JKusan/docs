## Arming & Disarming the System Automatically

A "Smart" security system is different from the traditional alarm system panel that you're used to that requires manually arming
and disarming the system using a keypad. The best way to use your new Smart Home Monitor system is to automatically arm
and disarm the system as you come and go based on _presence_. You and your family members will set up each of your phones
as presence sensors, and you automate the arming & disarming when you leave the house and come home. So, when you leave
the house your system will automatically arm. When you come home, Smart Home Monitor will automatically disarm before 
you open your door!

To set this up, [configure Routines](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/205380034){:target="_blank"} to set Smart Home Monitor
to _Armed (Away)_ when the _Goodbye_ routine is triggered and _Disarmed_ when the _I'm Back_ routine is triggered. You can
then automate the triggering of these routines with _Everyone Leaves_ and when _Someone Arrives_. Make sure every adult 
in your home is [invited to your SmartThings account](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/206531123-How-do-I-share-my-account-and-manage-users-){:target="_blank"}
and has their [phone set up as a presence sensor](https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/200292279-How-do-I-add-my-phone-as-a-device-){:target="_blank"}.
