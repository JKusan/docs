# Wiring

Now the fun part! Wiring your Konnected device is pretty easy, but it can be tedious. The key to success is patience and
planning ahead!

## Replacing an Existing Alarm Panel

If your home is already wired with an existing alarm panel, you'll first need to identify the sensor wires coming out of
your walls and into the alarm panel and disconnect them from the zone inputs. Most alarm panels have a wiring diagram, 
and if you're lucky, the wires may already be labeled with which sensor they go to. If not, do yourself a favor and label
them before you begin re-wiring.

Most motion senors or glass-break detectors are wired with 4-conductor cable, two for the power and two for the signal.
If your powered sensors are already receiving power from your existing alarm panel, _you do not need to disconnect the
 power wires_. Just disconnect the signal wires from the alarm panel zone inputs.
 
### End-of-line Resistors

Many wired alarm panels will have _end-of-line resistors_ connected via crimp connectors to one end of the pair of each 
sensor or zone wires. Remove these resistors and the crimp connector when disconnecting wires from your alarm panel,
they're not needed for this project!

### Sensors Wired Together in Zones

Many alarm installations have two or more sensors wired together to create _zones_. A _zone_ is simply a grouping of
sensors. If any one of the sensors in a zone is open, then the zone will report as open. This is commonly used, for example,
to group together multiple windows in the same room when you don't nececessarily need to know exactly which _specific_
window is open, just that _any_ window is open.

It's up to you whether or not you want to keep the sensors wired in zones, or separate them to monitor each sensor
individually. The number of sensors/zones you can monitor is limited by the number of _input pins_ on the Konnected device.
Each device can support up to 6 sensors or zones. You can always add more Konnected devices to support virtually
an unlimited number of sensors.  
 
## Installation Without a Existing Alarm Panel

If your home is "pre-wired" with sensors but no alarm panel is installed, or you're building/renovating home and 
wiring it with sensors, then this should be simple! You _do not need an existing alarm panel_ to use Konnected Security.
You'll be wiring the sensors directly to the Konnected device. Use a 12V DC power adapter to power the device.
