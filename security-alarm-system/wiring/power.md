The Konnected device can accept 6V to 24V DC in the base, or 5V DC via USB cable directly to the logic board. If you're
 replacing an existing alarm panel system, you can probably draw 12V DC from the existing system. Many alarm systems also
 have back-up batteries that you can take advantage of in this case.
 
### Powering the Device from an Existing Alarm Panel

Find the _AUX Power Output_ on your existing alarm panel. It should be two screw terminals labeled with `+` and `-` or `G`. 
Loosen the screw terminals with a screwdriver. Using a _male-to-female_ jumper wire, insert the metal male end under the
first screw terminal and tighten so it stays in contact with the metal. Repeat for the second screw terminal.

Now connect the female end of the jumper wire from the `+` terminal to one of the four pins labeled `U1` on the Konnected
device base. Connect the wire from the `-` or `G` terminal to one of the `GND` on the bottom left of the Konnected base.

### Power using a Power Adapter

You can use almost any power adapter with a standard 5.5mm power plug to provide power to the Konnected device as long
as it outputs between 6V and 24V DC (it's usually clearly labeled). We recommend using a **12V DC** power adapter when 
possible because most alarm system components are also 12V.
 
For most installations without power from an existing alarm panel, we recommend a [12V 2 amp power adapter](https://www.amazon.com/TMEZON-Power-Adapter-Supply-2-1mm/dp/B00Q2E5IXW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1500792679&sr=8-3&keywords=12v+power+adapter&linkCode=ll1&tag=konnected-io-20&linkId=6e536f3412becae1fbc9deb536cb1a43).
This gives you plenty of power for one or more Konnected device and any motion sensors that need it. 
 
### Power using USB

If you only need to power the Konnected device, you can use most any USB power adapter and a Micro USB cable. Phone chargers
work great. Note that when powering by USB, you cannot draw power for external devices like motion sensors or a siren.
