## 3V High Level Trigger Relay Module

These 3V relays work off of the 3.3V power delivered by the NodeMCU board. These relays were included in Konnected DIY
kits before mid-August 2017. They're also available on Amazon [individually](https://www.amazon.com/Icstation-Channel-3V-Optocoupler-Development/dp/B01FK11HV4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1503174798&sr=8-2&keywords=icstation+3v+relay&linkCode=ll1&tag=konnected-io-20&linkId=b4310d1b35773f41b3273617b106988d)
