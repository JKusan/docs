## 5V High/Low Level Trigger Relay Module 

We've tested these 5V relay modules and started including them in kits shipped in mid August 2017 and later. **These relays
require 5V power from the NodeMCU base**, so you must power the device at the base (not by USB) for the relay to work.

For this application, keep the jumper setting on for high level trigger (it's shipped in this configuration). These are
also [available on Amazon in a 5-pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XAGT052/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=konnected-io-20&linkId=edde017f27ebdaa43cf06dfaee293823).
