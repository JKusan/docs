title: Connecting Jumper Wires to In-wall Wiring
layout: default
---

**Jumper Wires** make it easy to create tight connections between your in-wall wiring and the Konnected device. Most 
in-wall wiring is 22 AWG solid copper wire. This type of wire fits perfectly with the jumper wires 
included in the  [Konnected Alarm Panel DIY kit](https://store.konnected.io/products/wired-alarm-system-complete-kit) or
[commonly available online](/buying-guide).

Use a wire stripper to strip about a centimeter of wire insulation from the end of the wire. If you don't have wire
strippers, you can use a pair of scissors or razor to gently score the wire insulation without cutting the copper core.
  Then use your fingernail to peel off the insulation, exposing the copper wire.

Holding the copper wire tightly in your fingers, push it firmly into the female end of the jumper cable. Be careful to
not let the copper wire bend or break as you push it in. The wire should be snug in the jumper cable connector.
