# Connect to WiFi
Before wiring and mounting your device, you first need to set up WiFi and establish the network connection to 
SmartThings.

1. Power on the device for the first time by plugging in a micro-USB cable and connecting it
 to any USB charger or computer. Or you can use any 6V to 24V DC power adapter plugged into the circular power port on
  the device base.

1. When the Konnected device is powered on you should see a slow blinking LED indicating that it's trying to connect to WiFi. 
Until WiFi is configured, the device will broadcast its own WiFi network named like `konnected-security_XXXXXX` for configuration.

 network as your SmartThings hub.
