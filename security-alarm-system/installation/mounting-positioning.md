## Positioning

When deciding where to mount your Konnected board, you need to consider the location of your wires, power, and wifi 
signal strength. If you're retrofitting an old alarm system panel, you may want to mount the board inside the panel, but
be aware that the metal enclosure will adversely affect the wifi signal strength. 

To prevent wifi signal loss, you may want to leave the door off of the alarm panel, or consider mounting the Konnected
board outside of the alarm panel enclosure.

### Checking Wifi Signal

To check the Wifi signal strength, open the SmartThings app and go to _Automation_ -> _SmartApps_ -> 
_Konnected Security (Connect)_ -> scroll down and _Tap to view device status_ -> scroll down to view the _Wifi signal 
strength_. You should have at least 50% wifi signal strength for reliable function.


## Mounting

You can mount the Konnected components on any non-conductive surface. We sell [DIY Mounting Kits](https://store.konnected.io/products/konnected-security-mounting-kit)
in our store which contain a blue acrylic or plexiglass board that works nicely as an attractive mounting surface. The board
can easily then be mounted anywhere using double-sided mounting tape or mounting hardware.

### Mounting Kit Instructions

1. Position the components on the board to your liking and use a pen or sharp tool to mark the location of each mounting
 hole

1. Use a 3/32" (or 2.5mm) drill bit to drill smaller holes for the relay board 

1. Use a 1/8" (or 3.2mm) drill bit to drill holes for the NodeMCU board(s)

1. Remove the protective film on both sides of the acrylic sheet

1. Position the components on the board, secure with screws, and hand-tighten nuts on the opposite side.
