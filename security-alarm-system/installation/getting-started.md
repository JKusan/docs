## Getting Started with Konnected Security

This guide will walk you step-by-step through connecting your new or existing home security system wiring to SmartThings
with Konnected Security, an inexpensive WiFi capable device with our open-source software that you can 
[buy from us](https://store.konnected.io/products/wired-alarm-system-complete-kit) or 
[build yourself](/security-alarm-system/buying-guide).
 
### Materials and Requirements
1. A NodeMCU development board and base (one for every 6 sensors/zones)
1. A relay for triggering the siren, strobe or alarm (optional)
1. Jumper wires for connecting to in-wall wiring
1. A [SmartThings Hub](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Hub-2nd-Generation/dp/B010NZV0GE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&linkCode=ll1&tag=konnected-io-20&linkId=cf246167345ebc042f799b5d0d9383ed)
1. A stable WiFi internet connection
 
[Support this project by buying one of our DIY Kits!](https://store.konnected.io/products/wired-alarm-system-complete-kit)
The kits contain all the materials you need, and come pre-loaded with Konnected firmware and software. Just plug in and
configure with your smartphone.

### Insert the NodeMCU board into the base
Carefully line up the pins on the NodeMCU board with the base, ensuring the pin labels match. Press the board in evenly 
until seated in the base.

If you've purchased one of our kits, the software is pre-loaded. Continue to **[Connect to WiFi](/security-alarm-system/installation/connect-wifi)**.
 
If your NodeMCU was not preloaded with our firmware, the instructions and code for flashing firmware are in the
[konnected-security README on GitHub](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security).
